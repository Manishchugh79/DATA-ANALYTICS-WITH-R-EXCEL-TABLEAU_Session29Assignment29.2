4. Associated Data Files
You should form a table on a worksheet titled "class list" that includes the names and test scores of your students. You have 7 students in your class, their names are: Allen, Borlin, Catlin, Dorsey, Eugene, Finneran, and Greco. Their scores on the first 3 tests are as follows:

Test 1Test 2Test 3AllenTest 89Test 78Test 89BorlinTest 67Test 56Test 66CatlinTest 78Test 76Test 76DorseyTest 56Test 34Test 45EugeneTest 26Test 100Test 99FinerranTest 99Test 98Test 97GrecoTest 78Test 87Test 88

5. Problem Statement
• Below your table, create a graph showing the students' rounded averages. Be sure to include appropriate labeling and spacing, so that the graph is non-repetitive and the scale is appropriate. Hint: A score of 100 is the highest possible.
• Insert a new worksheet. Use the Goal Seek feature to find the value that Eugene needed on Test 1 in order to earn honors for the course. Show your work by displaying an updated table. Title the worksheet "Eugene's dream." Hint: Do not worry about rounding Eugene's new "score" for Test 1. If done properly, the rest of your table should update accordingly.


• From the data on your "class list" worksheet, provide the Descriptive Statistics of your students' rounded averages. For the output, create a new worksheet and choose to display "summary statistics". Rename this worksheet "Descriptive Statistics".
